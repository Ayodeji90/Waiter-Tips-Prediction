# Waiter Tips Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts waiter tips based on various factors such as meal cost, table size, day of the week, time of day, and customer characteristics. By analyzing these factors, the model provides insights to waitstaff and restaurant managers to optimize service and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Features
- Predicts waiter tips based on total bill,tip,sex, smoker,day, time and size
- Provides insights to waitstaff and restaurant managers to optimize service and enhance customer satisfaction
