# Water-Tips-Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts water consumption patterns based on various factors. By analyzing factors such as weather conditions, day of the week, time of day, and historical usage data, the model provides personalized recommendations and insights to users to optimize water usage and promote conservation efforts.

## Features
- Predicts water consumption patterns
- Analyzes weather conditions, day of the week, time of day, and historical usage data
- Provides personalized recommendations and insights to users
